    "raw_content": "Two years after scientists from the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), released a tiny parasitic wasp into South India’s tapioca fields, the crop that once faced near devastation from an invasive pest is now thriving again. Farmers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Puducherry report that their tapioca harvests have returned to pre-outbreak levels. This marks a rare success in controlling a major agricultural pest without chemicals. Cassava, better known as tapioca, is grown on about 1.73 lakh hectares in India, with Tamil Nadu and Kerala together contributing more than 90% of total production. Before the outbreak, yields averaged 35 tonnes per hectare, far above the global average of 10.76 tonnes, and India exported value-added tapioca products worth nearly ₹200 million annually, according to NBAIR officials. However, the mealybug’s arrival in Thrissur, Kerala, in April 2020 changed this landscape. By 2021, nearly 1.43 lakh hectares were infested, and some areas of Tamil Nadu saw yields collapse to 5–12 tonnes per hectare. The pest fed on the plant sap, causing leaf curling, stunted growth, and poor tuber formation. With no effective local predators, the infestation escalated quickly and posed a serious economic threat to farmers, they said. Chemical sprays were considered, but repeated pesticide use was costly, harmful to the environment, and unsustainable for small farmers. ICAR–NBAIR scientists instead turned to classical biological control, a strategy that introduces a natural enemy from the pest’s native region to restore ecological balance. “In nature, every species has natural enemies that keep its population in check. Scientists identified a tiny parasitic wasp, Anagyrus lopezi, that specifically targets the cassava mealybug. The wasp lays its eggs inside the pest, and the developing larvae consume it from within, naturally reducing mealybug numbers without harming other crops,” S. N. ",

Ilaiyaraaja the statement of accounts with respect to the revenue earned by it through the ‘commercial exploitation’ of the songs composed by him for certain movies in the past. Appearing before Justice N. Senthilkumar of the Madras High Court, senior counsel Vijay Narayan said, his client had brought the statement of accounts to the court in a sealed cover and was ready to place it before the court for the perusal of the judge alone. He refused to share a copy of the statement of accounts with the counsel representing the musician, by claiming confidentiality with respect to the commercial information regarding the proceeds received from platforms such as Apple Music, Amazon Music, Spotify, and so on. The senior counsel said, the musician would not be entitled to such commercial information unless he succeeds in establishing his legal right over the songs which he had composed for various movies after receiving due remuneration from the film producers. On the other hand, senior counsel S. Prabakaran, appearing on behalf of Mr. Ilaiyaraaja, told the judge that the Supreme Court had time and again deprecated the practice of submitting information in sealed covers. He insisted that Sony Music must be directed to disclose the details. After hearing both sides, Justice Senthilkumar decided not to open the sealed cover since Mr. Narayan also informed him that Sony Music had approached the Supreme Court last week for the transfer of the suit filed by Mr. Ilaiyarajaa from the Madras High Court to the Bombay High Court. The senior counsel said, the music company had filed a civil suit before the Bombay High Court in 2021 for declaring it as the copyright holder of the songs composed by Mr. Ilaiyaraaja for certain films and to restrain him from claiming any commercial rights over them. After four long years since that suit was filed, the musician had filed the pre",

According to the Madanayakanahalli police, the accused, along with three others, barged into the house of the woman, threatened her with dire consequences, and demanded money and valuables. While three of the accused allegedly raped her, the other two stood guard. The woman raised a complaint following which a police team led by Superintendent of Police C.K. Baba rushed to the spot, took stock of the situation, and tracked down two of the accused within hours in a night-long operation. Efforts are on to trace the other three accused, who are on the run. The victim was later taken to a hospital for medical treatment. The probe revealed that the woman was working in a salon and stayed in a rented accommodation. She used to get a lot of customers, which irked the other tenants. One of the tenants, a teacher, sought the help of her student after repeated complaints to the land-owner did not help. The police said that the student sought the help of his friends, who are local goons, to scare away the woman and impress his teacher. The accused barged into the house, threatened the woman, raped her before taking her valuables, including cash and mobile phones, according to the police .

Speaking to reporters in Thane during the Diwali celebrations, Mr. Shinde affirmed the Sangh’s “strong nationalist credentials and commitment to public service”. “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is a staunchly patriotic and nationalist organisation. The RSS always steps forward to help when the country is in crisis,” Mr. Shinde said. The comments by the Shiv Sena chief come days after theKarnataka Cabinet decided to bring rules, apparently to check RSS activities, including marching on the roads and holding events in public places and government premises. InUttar Pradesh, stateCongresspresident Ajay Rai had said that he had written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah seeking a ban on the RSS, claiming that it has been involved in “anti-national activities.” Mr. Shinde said the attempts to restrict the Sangh’s work were “unfortunate” and “condemnable”. About the upcoming civic elections in Maharashtra, Mr. Shinde said the BJP-led Mahayuti will win the polls. Besides the BJP and Shinde’s Shiv Sena, the coalition also has the NCP, led by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, as a partner. “We won the Lok Sabha elections and secured a huge majority in the assembly polls. The saffron flag of Mahayuti will fly high in the local body elections, too,” he said. Mr. Shinde said the Mahayuti retained power in the state due to the “magic” of the ‘Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana’, which provides monthly financial aid of ₹1,500 each to eligible women beneficiaries. The scheme was rolled out when Shinde was the Chief Minister. The Deputy Chief Minister also asserted that thepopular scheme won’t be scrapped.

    "raw_content": "The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board’s campaign to augment groundwater resources in the city,‘Prathi Intlo Inkudu Guntha’ or rainwater harvesting pit in every house, according to official data, is yielding results. Similarly, as a relief from the high summer demand, the users’ dependence on water tankers for daily essentials has seen a decline. Official estimates show that the city received over 30% excess rainfall during the monsoon. While the average rainfall is over 80 cm every year in Hyderabad, the amount absorbed by the earth’s surface is not more than 1%, and the majority is the flood that drains into the Musi river. Citing Ground Water Department’s data, the Board said “the groundwater level, which had dropped by an average of 14 to 28 meters last summer, has risen by two to 11 meters due to the impact of RWHs. The groundwater level has increased by an average of three to nine meters compared to last year.” A division-wise comparison of demand for water tankers, which the Board monitors keenly, also showed that the demand decreased by 12 to 50%. “Up to 80% of thedemand for tankerscomes from divisions such as Kukatpally, Nizampet, Pragathi Nagar, Serilingampally, Madhapur, Manikonda, and SR Nagar. However, due to the increase in groundwater due to the impact of pits, the booking of tankers has decreased,” it explained. The maximum 50% decline was from Vinaynagar division, Durgam Cheruvu (37%), Qutbullapur (35%), Sahebnagar (32%). HMWS&SB managing director K. Ashok Reddy observed that there would be no need of a new water supply scheme in the future, if every house harvested rainwater and recharged groundwater. The borewell levels would naturally rise, ensuring access to daily household needs, and saving vast water transport and treatment costs.

Speaking to the media on Wednesday (October 22, 2025), Mr. Natesan said that if other States were implementing the National Education Policy (NEP), Kerala too should implement it. The Communist Party of India’s (CPI) opposition to the NEP would disappear once Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan holds talks with them, he said. “If everyone is implementing the NEP, Kerala too should implement it. When all other States are implementing the NEP, why should Kerala stand apart? The CPI ultimately agrees to everything. For the CPI, it is better to remain silent. They are opposing the NEP by calling it saffronisation, but see how far saffron has advanced. It has been ruling the country for more than ten years now. Once Mr. Vijayan intervenes, the CPI’s opposition will fade away,” Mr. Natesan said. On the Sabarimala gold theft case, he said, “Let the one who has eaten the salt drink the water.” He said that all devaswom boards should be dissolved. “Why is the Sabarimala gold theft case being turned against the State government? The Opposition’s demand for resignation of Devaswom Minister V.N. Vasavan is purely political. A new system should be introduced and an Indian Administrative Service officer should be appointed as Secretary. The Kerala High Court is taking strong action and the government too is taking appropriate steps. Then why should Hindu organisations protest?” Mr. Natesan asked.

However, the case took a dark turn after Shamshudeen Chaudhary, a resident of Malerkotla, filed a complaint on October 17 citing a social media post by Aqil in August. In the post,Aqil allegedly expressed fear for his life and accused familymembers of conspiring against him. Chaudhary also shared a diary screenshot with the Panchkula police, Haryana DGP OP Singh, and chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, requesting a “fair and impartial probe.” Based on these claims, an FIR was registered on Monday at Mansa Devi Complex police station. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Srishti Gupta confirmed the case falls under Sections 103(1) (murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The FIR states that Aqil had discovered illicit relations between his father and wife and alleged that his mother and sister were conspiring to kill him or implicate him in a false case. Aqil is survived by his wife, a five-year-old son, and a seven-year-old daughter. Mohammad Mustafa, when contacted, dismissed the allegations, saying, “The registration of an FIR absolutely does not mean that someone’s guilt has been proven.” He added, “The real investigation will begin now after the FIR is registered, and in a few days, the truth will come out before the public.” Mustafa also described Aqil as “not mentally stable” and said the late youth had post",

The chopper,carrying President Droupadi Murmu, had landed at the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium in Pathanamthitta's Pramadam for her Sabarimala visit. A senior police officer of the district said that the decision to land President Murmu's helicopter at the Rajiv Gandhi stadium was made at the last moment, after which the helipad was created there late on Tuesday, according to PTI news agency. The landing was originally planned at Nilackal near Pamba, but it was changed to Pramadam due to inclement weather. The concrete of the helipad at the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium had not set as it was built overnight, the officer said. \"The concrete had not set completely and therefore, it could not handle the helicopter's weight when it landed and depressions were formed where the wheels touched the ground,\" PTI quoted the officer. After the President left for Pamba by road, several policemen and fire force personnel were seen pushing the helicopter's wheels out of the small depressions created when it landed on the concrete. The President landed in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday evening for her four-day official Kerala visit. She left on Wednesday morning for Pathanamthitta district, where the hill shrine of Sabarimala is located. From Pramadam, Murmu left for Pamba, the foothills of Sabarimala, via road.",

The situation escalated on Monday when around 200 people blocked the Bharatpur-Karauli state highway near Bayana town, causing a traffic jam that stretched nearly two kilometres. When police arrived to disperse the crowd, the protesters refused to cooperate and allegedly began pelting stones, injuring officers and damaging two police vehicles. “After a land dispute in the village, around 200 people gathered at Bhim Nagar Tiraha in Bayana town.

Justice Sachin Datta made the prima facie observation while staying the proceedings initiated by the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes against Axis Bank, its Managing Director and the Chief Executive Officer . \"Prima facie, in the context of the facts of the present case, Sections 3 and of the Atrocities Act are not attracted inasmuch the same cannot be invoked to preclude/ prevent the exercise of mortgage right/security interest of the petitioner,\" the judge said in an order passed on October 16. The Commission had ordered Axis Bank's MD and CEO to appear in person after a representation was made by a person alleging violation under Sections 3 and of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act . Section 3 penalises wrongfully occupation or cultivation of land belonging to a member of the SC/ST community, while Section 3 relates to the punishment of wrongful dispossession of a member of the SC/ST community of his land or premises. According to the petition before the court, a credit facility of₹16.69 crore was sanctioned by Axis Bank to Sundev Appliances Ltd, secured by a mortgaged property in Maharashtra's Vasai, in 2013. After the borrower defaulted, the account was declared a non-performing asset in 2017, prompting the bank to invoke its rights under the law, which was followed by a civil dispute over ownership of the mortgaged property. One of the persons involved in the dispute, thereafter, approached the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. The high court stayed the order saying the proceedings pending before the Commission were without jurisdiction. \"The proceedings pending before respondent no.1 , particularly, the summons issued therein which requires the MD & CEO of the pe",

The plea has also sought directions to the RBI, NPCI, and UPI platforms to disallow any monetary transactions involving unregistered gaming applications.

    "raw_content": "New Delhi, For a tragedy-struck widow, who lost her husband in a train accident in 2002, the Supreme Court went the extra mile to ensure that she is duly compensated by the Railways after years of struggle. Saynokta Devi's husband Vijay Singh had a valid railway ticket from Bakhtiyarpur station to go to Patna by the Bhagalpur-Danapur Inter­city Express on March 21, ­2002, but he accidentally fell down from the running train at the originating station itself, due to heavy rush inside the compartment and died instantly. What followed was a legal battle for next two decades, as Devi's claim for compensation was turned down by the Railway Claims Tribunal and the Patna High Court on the ground that the deceased was of unsound mind. Aggrieved by the high court's order denying her claim, she, through her lawyer Fauzia Shakil, approached the apex court. The Supreme Court in 2023 rejected the reasoning given by the Railway Claims Tribunal and the Patna High Court and set aside the orders terming them \"completely absurd\", \"imaginary\" and \"contrary to the undisputed facts on record\". \"What emerges is the fact that the appellant's claim was not accepted by both the Tribunal and the High Court solely on the ground that the deceased was of unsound mind and he was knocked down by an unidentified train,\" the top court had noted in its order of February 2, 2023. A bench headed by Justice Surya Kant had observed that if the deceased would have been of unsound mind, it would have been nearly impossible for him to purchase a valid railway ticket for travel to Patna and could not have tried to board the train all by himself. The top court directed the Railways to pay the widow within two months a compensation of₹4 lakh with six per cent interest per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition. But to her bad luck, her local counsel could not convey her the order as he passed away. The railways on other hand tried to comply with the order and wrote different letters to Devi but c",

It has invited public feedback on the amendments by November 6. The definition of “synthetically generated information” is a key proposed change. It has been described as any information “artificially or algorithmically created, generated, modified or altered using a computer resource in a manner that appears reasonably authentic or true.” With this definition, the government seeks to bring AI-generated content under the due diligence and takedown obligations applicable to unlawful online information. The draft amendments make labelling and traceability mandatory for synthetic content. Intermediaries offering tools that create or modify digital media are required to ensure such information carries a visible or audible label or an embedded permanent metadata identifier that clearly marks it as AI-generated. For images or videos, the label must cover at least 10% of the surface area. For audio, it must be played during the first 10% of its duration. Intermediaries will be prohibited from suppressing or removing such identifiers, making it difficult to disguise the origin of AI-generated content. For large social media platforms, referred to as significant social media intermediaries, the obligations are more elaborate. These companies will be required to ask users to declare whether their uploaded content is synthetically-generated before publication. They must also deploy “reasonable and proportionate technical measures” like automated detection systems to verify the same. Verified or declared synthetic content must be clearly labelled or accompanied by a visible notice, allowing users to distinguish authentic media from manipulated material. Failure to comply could expose these",
