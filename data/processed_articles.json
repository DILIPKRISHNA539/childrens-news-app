      "raw_content": "The Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services Department received 44 fire calls across the State onDeepavali day,including 18 within the limits of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation GHMC. Officials from the Fire Control Room said that of the total, 38 were categorised as small fires, three as medium, and one as serious. The medium fire calls were reported from Chandulal Baradari, Yakutpura, and Mahabubabad, while the serious call came from an industrial unit in Sangareddy. Preliminary findings suggest that the Sangareddy fire was caused by a short circuit and not linked to fireworks. No major fire incidents related to crackers were reported this year, an official from the fire control room confirmed. In comparison, the department had received 33 fire calls during Deepavali in 2024, all related to crackers, including three major mishaps. One such incident occurred on Street Number 18 in Himayat Nagar, where a third-floor flat was gutted. While property damage was significant, no serious injuries were reported in any of the incidents, officials added.

It's a Sanatan Hindu festival, and why are you cursing the festival? Why are you using words against the festival? But to say that BJP is celebrating Diwali, to say that BJP is bursting crackers like this, to say that BJP is doing such wrong things, I feel very embarrassed,\" Sirsa said. He also accused former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ofbanning firecrackers in the cityduring the AAP regime to \"garner the votes of a particular community\". \"Since this morning, Arvind Kejriwal's entire team has been constantly cursing Diwali. Sanjay Singh and his colleagues have been tweeting since last night, asking to stop celebrating Diwali. Aam Aadmi Party president is cursing the BJP,\" Sirsa said. He later lashed out at claims linkingDiwali celebrations to the rise in pollution levelsin the city and said: \"Those who are blaming Diwali for this, it is a lie. This is being done only to please some section. The admirers of Aurangzeb and Akbar are saying this; those who had put Tipu Sultan's photo in the Vidhan Sabha are saying this.\" The Environment Minister also noted that this years post-Diwali rise in pollution levels in Delhi was significantly lower compared to previous years. Presenting data during a press conference, Sirsa said that the difference between the Air Quality Index AQI recorded before and after Diwali was only 11 points, and asked: \"Will you hold Diwali responsible for this? Will you hold the faith of all the Sanatanis and Hindus in Delhi accountable? What is the fault in",

Stalin reviewed precautionary measures being undertaken in the city and its surrounding districts and the Cauvery delta districts that have been witnessing steady downpour.

Similar alert was sounded for neighbouring Puducherry union territory as well. \"Heavy rain is likely in the entire north coastal belt, but extremely heavy rain is expected in the above districts,\" the official said. According to him, an orange alert has been sounded for Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Kallakurichi, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari. A red alert indicates extremely heavy rain of over 20 cm in 24 hours, while an orange alert means very heavy rain of 11 cm to 20 cm.
