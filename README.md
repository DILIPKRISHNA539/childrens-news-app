🛡️ Sensitive Content Filtering
The system automatically filters articles containing:

Violence (murder, killed, attack, shooting, etc.)
Terrorism (terrorist, bomb, explosion, etc.)
Crime (rape, assault, kidnap, etc.)
Graphic content (blood, weapon, corpse, etc.)

19 articles filtered in latest run! ✅
🤖 AI Processing Workflow
Hybrid Approach (Efficient & Cost-Effective)

Filter Sensitive Content - Before AI processing
Simplify Language - One Gemini API call per article
Truncate by Age - Python-based word count truncation

Benefits:

✅ Only 1 API call per article (vs. 3)
✅ Consistent simplification across age groups
✅ 67% cost reduction
✅ Faster processing

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. API Key Not Found
bash❌ GOOGLE_API_KEY not found in environment
Solution: Check your .env file and ensure the key is correct
2. Rate Limit Exceeded
bash❌ Rate limit hit! Wait a moment.
Solution: Wait 60 seconds and retry. The script has automatic delays.
3. Model Not Found
bash❌ litellm.NotFoundError: GeminiException
Solution: Update model name to gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite in .env
4. No Articles Extracted
bash⚠️ No articles extracted!
Solution: Check the internet connection and the source URLs
Debug Mode
